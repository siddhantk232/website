This page includes information about all the tools I use for software development. I also experiment with various small tools that I like to tweet about. So, if you want to know about them too, follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/siddhantk232).

# software tools

## os+tools

I am currently using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). I have used Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Manjaro in the past. After a lot of distro-hopping, I finally settled on using Arch which is a pretty stable distro to live with. I use it with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) which is a [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager). Apart from these two combos, there are many tools that make my system complete. You can see all my configs in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/siddhantk232/dotfiles) repo on Github.

For editing and writing code, I recently switched to [neovim](https://neovim.io/). I have used VS Code in the past with vim emulation but it is not that smooth when you add the VS Code vim plugin. Now talking about vim is in itself an article which I will definitely write soon. For now, all my neovim config, plugins, and other configs are on my dotfiles repo on Github.

I use [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal emulator. You can learn more about alacritty here. An interesting fact about this is it is GPU accelerated which is a good thing for dedicated GPU owners. You can check my alacritty config in my dotfiles repo.

I prefer using the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/). I have tried bash and zsh, but fish has pretty good defaults and I never had to change them.

Apart from these mentioned above, I use many tools like curl, google chrome and discord. And many more which every software developer uses.

## software development tools/languages

My main language for software development is javascript/typescript. I recently learned typescript and it is pretty amazing to work with.

For the frontend, I prefer reactjs (or NextJs) for medium to large projects. For simple web projects like a blog, I would prefer using a static site generator like eleventy or gatsby.

For designing/prototyping, I use Figma. I am not an expert in UI design but I still like making designs before writing the code.

All the code I write is available on my [Github profile](https://github.com/siddhantk232).

I am also learning [Golang](https://golang.org/) for building backend services.

## laptop and other hardware

I use this Lenovo legion y540. The specs of this machine are:

- 1080p display
- i5-9300h 4 core processor
- 8GB 2666mhz memor
- 512GB SSD
- nvidia gtx 1650

When using vscode, I was planning to add another 8GB memory module. But it is not super necessary for now. My memory usage idles at ~500MB (after boot). And on the heaviest load, I still don't consume more than 80%. Still, I will add another 8GB ram for android development but I do not see this happening soon.

With my laptop, I use this [Logitech wireless mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-in/products/mice/m190-wireless-mouse.html). And for listening to music, I use this [Onepluse bullets wireless z earphones](https://www.oneplus.in/product/oneplus-bullets-wireless-z).

I am a big fan of mechanical keyboards but they are quite expensive for a student like me. So I use this cheap [redgear keyboard](https://www.amazon.in/Redgear-L-Claw-Mechanical-Keyboard-Windows-Key/dp/B07P33Y2CJ) with kailh blues and I am saving money to buy the Ducky one 2 mini keyboard. I also want to try the [moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keyboard by ZSA.

I use Nokia 6 2018 as my smartphone. Planning to upgrade to the Nokia 7 series in 2021.

Thank you for reading till the end. If you have any recommendations about the tools you want me to try, tell me in the comments.
